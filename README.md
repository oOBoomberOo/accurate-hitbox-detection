# Accurate Hitbox Detection
A simple datapack library for detecting if one entity is colliding with another entity  
P.S. this datapack is made to completely ignore hitbox of any kind of projectile. if you want to detect projectile colliding with other projectile you have to use other library

# How to use
you simply have to run ```/execute as <target> at @s run function boomber:accurate_hitbox/detect``` at whatever entity you want.  
if it colliding with something the target entity will get tag "boomber.accurate_hitbox.hit", Easy isn't it?
